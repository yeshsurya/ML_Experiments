Experiments not typical for conceptual insights
<hr width="50%" size="2" color="blue" align="center">

<h2>Gradient Descent</h2>
<ul>
<li>
  surrogate gradients : Gradient descent using surrogate gradients applied to create a matrix whose determinant is a given number
</li>
</ul>

<h2>The Basic GAN</h2>
<ul>
<li>
  A simple experiment to find Nash Equilibrium for a problem of generating a Matrix whose determinant is what we intend to be. 
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Monte Carlo Tree Search</h2>
<ul>
<li>
  A template code to use MCTS to drive decision making process towards a specific objective. That is to make best selection of hyperparameters which maximizes any choosen performance function. 
</li>
</ul>
